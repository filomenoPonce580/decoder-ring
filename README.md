# Decoder
The Decoder Ring application is designed to encode and decode messages utlizing various algorithms.

# Project Description
The Decoder Ring application encompasses the following encryption and decryption techniques:

Caesar Shift: Handles shifting of letters in the alphabet based on a given shift value.
Polybius Square: Utilizes a 5x5 grid to encode and decode messages by mapping each letter to a unique pair of coordinates.
Substitution Cipher: Encrypts and decrypts messages by substituting letters with corresponding characters from a provided alphabet.

# Learning Objectives Achieved
Throughout this project, I have accomplished the following learning objectives:

Built complex algorithms to implement the Caesar shift, Polybius square, and substitution cipher encoding and decoding methods.
Developed a strong understanding of unit testing using Mocha and Chai frameworks to ensure the accuracy and reliability of my algorithms.
Gained proficiency in writing different expect() methods to thoroughly test code functionality.
